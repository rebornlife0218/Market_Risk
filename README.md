Suppose you invest in a portfolio that consists of the above five individual stocks Calculate VaR (1 day, 95%) of a portfolio equally invested in these five stocks.The data to be collected is “daily ” data from 2018/02/19 to 2023/02/20. Portfolio market value is USD 100 million.
1. Apple
2. Microsoft
3. Starbucks
4. McDonald's
5. Tesla

 Compute VaR on this portfolio based on four methods
1. Full covariance model 
* For an asset or portolio, its VaR behaved as its market value multiplied by the volatility (the volatility and the correlation matrix) of the position.
* Must include forecasts for volatilities and correlation.
2. Diagonal model ( with one factor and the one factor is the stock market index )
* Assumption common movement in all assets is due to one common factor only, and the factor is the MARKET.

3. Beta model with one factor and the one factor is the stock market index 
4. Undiversified model ( i.e., the summation of individual VaR on each assets
