Suppose you invest in a portfolio that consists of the above five individual stocks Calculate VaR (1 day, 95%) of a portfolio equally invested in these five stocks.
1. Apple
2. Microsoft
3. Starbucks
4. McDonald's
5. Tesla
The data to be collected is “daily ” data from 2018/02/19 to 2023/02/20. Portfolio market value is USD 100 million.

 Compute VaR on this portfolio based on four methods
1. Full covariance model 
2. Diagonal model ( with one factor and the one factor is the stock market index 
3. Beta model with one factor and the one factor is the stock market index 
4. Undiversified model ( i.e., the summation of individual VaR on each assets
